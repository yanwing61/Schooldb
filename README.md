# Schooldb
A sample of using C# to connect with data from database.

Tried to improve the following:

● Build a search interface to find a teacher (by name)

● Use a ViewModel to display the courses taught by a teacher in
/Views/Teacher/Show.cshtml
(can display two courses for one teacher)

● Build the MVP for read functionality on the Students table

● Update Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml and /Content/Site.css to significantly change the
layout and design of your web application.
